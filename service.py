Oil Boilers Page**
- Trusted Oil Boiler Installation Experts

  At South Coast Plumbing and Heating, we specialise in installing high-quality oil boilers. With years of expertise, we are committed to providing exceptional service to our valued customers across Devon.

- What Are Oil Boilers?

  Oil boilers are reliable and efficient heating solutions for properties not connected to the gas grid. They burn heating oil to provide heat and hot water, making them ideal for rural homes and businesses. Modern oil boilers are designed to be energy-efficient, helping to reduce fuel costs and environmental impact.
  The lifespan of an oil boiler typically ranges between 15 to 20 years, depending on regular maintenance and servicing. By investing in a high-quality boiler and ensuring it is properly maintained, you can enjoy consistent heating and hot water for many years to come.

- Ask Us About Fitting your New Oil Boiler

  We understand that every property is unique, so we offer tailored solutions to meet your heating needs. Whether you‚Äôre replacing an old boiler or installing a new one, you can trust us to get the job done efficiently and to the highest standard.

- A New Boiler At A Great Price

Our dedicated team of fully certified experts are on hand to assist you. We can install a new, energy-efficient, cost-effective boiler for your home for a fixed-rate.

- Oil To Gas Conversion

  Get rid of your oil boiler and convert to gas central heating - we are available to complete the conversion in the Belfast area.

    - No need for an oil tank; we will remove it
    - Your inefficient oil boiler will be replaced by an energy-efficient gas model
    - Stored water is no longer required, so we remove the hot water cylinder
    - Your cold water storage tank is also no longer needed; you gain valuable space
    - Have complete control over your heating system with optional smart controls
    - Monthly energy bills will be lower
    - Oil leaks and oil theft are no longer a risk

    ### **Strict Content Quality Evaluation (NO Guesswork Allowed)**
    You are a **highly strict but fair content evaluator**. Your job is to **accurately measure quality improvements** and ensure a logical score adjustment.

    ---

    ### **üö® VERY IMPORTANT ‚Äì STRICT RULES üö®**
    - **You MUST compare the content to its previous version.** If no prior version is available, evaluate as usual.
    - **If improvements have been made, the score should increase.** If the score stays the same or drops, you must justify why.
    - **DO NOT suggest changes unrelated to the provided content.** No hallucinations, testimonials, or interactive elements.
    - **All feedback must be content-based, fact-driven, and specific.**
    - **You MUST provide at least 5 unique, real improvement areas**‚Äîno generic feedback.
    ---
    ### **Evaluation Criteria (Be Critical, But Only on Real Issues)**
    1. **Readability & Flow** ‚Äì Does the content read smoothly and professionally?
    2. **Logical Structure & Clarity** ‚Äì Is the content well-structured with clear headings and transitions?
    3. **Depth & Relevance** ‚Äì Does it provide unique insights and valuable details?
    4. **On Page SEO Optimization** ‚Äì Are keywords well-integrated and formatting SEO-friendly?
    5. **Accuracy & Credibility** ‚Äì Are all claims factually correct, with no vague statements?
    6. **Persuasiveness & CTA Strength** ‚Äì Are the calls to action compelling?
    7. **Spelling & Language Precision** ‚Äì Any typos or awkward phrasing?

    ---

    ### **Scoring System (Adjust Fairly Based on Changes)**
    - **0-3: Unacceptable** ‚Äì Major issues. Needs total rewrite.
    - **4-6: Below Average** ‚Äì Needs significant work before being usable.
    - **7: Average** ‚Äì Acceptable, but **lacks refinement**.
    - **8: Above Average** ‚Äì Good, but **not quite premium quality**.
    - **9: Almost There** ‚Äì High quality, **minor refinements needed**.
    - **10: Perfect** ‚Äì **Extremely rare.** Must be **flawless and highly persuasive**.

    ### **Content to Evaluate:**
    ```
    {state["home_page"]}
    {state["about_us_page"]}
    {state["service_page"]}
    {state["individual_service_page"]}
    {state["service_area_page"]}

    ```

    ### **Final Output Format (STRICTLY FOLLOW THIS)**
    **Quality Score: X/10**
    **Reason for Score (MUST justify if score drops or stays the same):**
    - **[Short but detailed explanation]**
    **Key Areas to Improve (MUST list 5+ real, unique issues):**
    - **[Issue 1]**
    - **[Issue 2]**
    - **[Issue 3]**
    - **[Issue 4]**
    - **[Issue 5]**
